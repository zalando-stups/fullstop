## FAQ

### What is an open endpoint

Only HTTPS (port 443) is allowed for incoming traffic. Exception: HTTP (port 80) might be
used to implement redirects to HTTPS. This is more convenient for users when browsing to
a website. All other ports are considered "insecure" and will cause a violation.

Web services should only grant access to authenticated / authorized users. Fullstop tries
to call the root url of every public ELB / EC2 instance wihtout any authentication.
If the result does not return a 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Forbidden) or some 5xx (Server error)
status, the endpoint is also considered "insecure".
